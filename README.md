# mls-mpm-solver
Coding an MLS-MPM fluid and foam solver.

## Mac and Windows
I am currently trying to build this on both my Macbook laptop with XCode and my Windows PC with Visual Studio. I want to use the built-in compliations for both IDEs. May have to write a script to edit the files with each commit.
